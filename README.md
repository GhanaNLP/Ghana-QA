# Ghana-QA

## Project Description

Ghana-QA is a Python script designed to automatically generate high-quality, groundable question-answer (QA) pairs from a corpus of Ghanaian news and research articles. The resulting dataset is ideal for training Question Answering models.

The core approach involves leveraging the **Nvidia Build API** (specifically the `mistral-medium-instruct` model) to analyze article content and produce a set of 10 distinct, search-optimized queries and their corresponding short answers, that do not exceed 160 characters.

## Dataset Availability

**The QA dataset generated by this project is intended for public use and will be made available through the Ghana NLP community page on Hugging Face.**

We aim to contribute to the growth of Natural Language Processing research and applications in the Ghanaian context by providing this valuable, high-quality, machine-readable resource.

## Community Contribution Goal

We are targeting the creation of a massive **10 Million Question-Answer pairs** to build the largest and highest-quality Ghanaian QA dataset ever.

To achieve this ambitious goal, we are actively seeking volunteers to help process the articles.

- **Target Goal:** 10,000,000 QA Pairs
- **Volunteer Commitment:** We need at least **50 dedicated volunteers** who are willing to run the repository for **6+ hours** each to help meet this data generation goal.

## Setup & Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Nvidia Build API Key:** A valid API key is required. Get one from the [NVIDIA NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/).
3. **Data Format:** Your input data must be a CSV file with a column named `content` containing the raw text of the articles. The dataset can be requested by writing to michsethowusu@gmail.com. Please state how many hours you can dedicate to running the code so we provide the corresponding amount of data.

## Usage Guide

You can run the code by running these commands in your terminal or command-line application: 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Before running the code, please request the dataset by writing to michsethowusu@gmail.com. The request should state how many hours you can dedicate to running the code so we provide the corresponding amount of data.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/GhanaNLP/Ghana-QA.git](https://github.com/GhanaNLP/Ghana-QA.git)
   cd Ghana-QA
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```
   pip install pandas python-dotenv requests
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**

   ```
   python generateQA.py
   ```

5. **Enter API Key and select the input dataset:** The script will prompt you for your Nvidia API key and also to select the input dataset which we have provided.
   

## Why contribute to this project?

Besides the fact that your work will contribute making information more accesible for more people in Ghana, you will also be added to our special contributors group in Ghana NLP. Our contributors ae the first to hear abotu opportunities available to community members. As a contributor, you will be given access to all our curated local language datasets on our [huggingface repo](https://huggingface.co/ghananlpcommunity/datasets/) in case you want to train your own Ghanain language models.
